## Report a Vulnerability

We're extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the Fastapi sqlmodel starter Open Source Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community volunteers.

You can email the private [tyvekzhang@gmail.com](tyvekzhang@gmail.com)
list with the security details and the details expected for
[all Fastapi sqlmodel starter bug reports](https://github.com/tyvekzhang/fastapi-sqlmodel-starter/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yaml).

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Fastapi sqlmodel starter
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Fastapi sqlmodel starter
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Fastapi sqlmodel starter depends on
  - For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

- You need help tuning Fastapi sqlmodel starter components for security
- You need help applying security related updates
- Your issue is not security related

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by Security Response Committee members within 3 working days.

Any vulnerability information shared with Security Response Committee stays within Fastapi sqlmodel starter project
and will not be disseminated to other projects unless it is necessary to get the issue fixed.

As the security issue moves from triage, to identified fix, to release planning we will keep the reporter updated.

## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the Fastapi sqlmodel starter Security Response Committee and the bug submitter.
We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. It is reasonable
to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested,
or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known)
to a few weeks. For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date
to be on the order of 7 days. The Fastapi sqlmodel starter Security Response Committee holds the final say when 
setting a disclosure date.
